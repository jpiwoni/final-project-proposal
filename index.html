    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Application Overview</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">My application will allow the end user to checkoff the places that they have traveled to. It will be their own checklist of the countries they have visited. Additionally, they can write a journal entry of what they liked and disliked about each place.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Technology Overview</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">My application with be written with HTML and will be hosted through Azure.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Proposal Last Updated</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Sunday November 21, 2021</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Feature List</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">A list of all countries where the end user may place a checkmark next to each country that they have traveled to. There will be a section where the end user can put in the countries they plan to visit soon as well as a section where one can explain their thoughts on the places they have visited.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Future Feature List</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">A world map where each country would light up when the end user would click on it, claiming that they have traveled there.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Basic Technical Features</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I will use previous knowledge that I have on HTML pages to make my application have a nice layout. I will try and make the page very appealing to the eye, and maybe even add some cool features that I have yet to learn.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">Advanced Technical Features</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">I would like to try and make the page as unique as it can be. Unsure of how I would do this, but it would look a lot more detailed than this basic overview. A nice world map would look really cool.</p>
